# Introduction
Gender segregation persists within academia, reinforcing structural inequalities by limiting men’s and women’s equal access to influential networks, mentorship opportunities, and high-status collaborations [@powell2018gender]. Understanding the causes of this macro level segregation is crucial to addressing and ultimately overcoming these disparities.

Coleman argued that to understand the causes of macro-level social phenomena, we must examine the micro-level mechanisms through which individual actions and interactions generate large-scale outcomes [@Coleman]. In this research project, I apply Social Network Analysis (SNA) to academic collaboration networks, as it provides a powerful framework for linking micro-level interactions to macro-level structures [@SNASS]. It allows me to examine researchers at the individual level (nodes), whom they collaborate with (ties), and, at the macro level, the overall structure of the network. By studying how researchers form, maintain, or avoid ties, I  can trace the micro-level behaviors that aggregate into macro-level patterns, such as gender segregation [@SNASS]. In this way, SNA operationalizes Coleman’s insight by linking individual decisions and interactions to emergent structural outcomes in academic networks.

A key mechanism behind gender segregation is gender homophily: the tendency for researchers to preferentially collaborate with colleagues of the same gender [@wang2023homophily]. Homophily is a fundamental principle in social network analysis, influencing the structure and evolution of networks by shaping the composition of ties between individuals. As Jochem Tolsma discusses in Social Network Analysis for Social Scientists [@SNASS], selective association can lead to the formation of tightly-knit clusters with shared characteristics, such as gender. Over time, these patterns reinforce existing social divisions, as individuals within a cluster are more likely to interact with one another than with those outside their group. This contributes to increased segregation, limiting cross-group interactions and perpetuating disparities in access to resources, opportunities, and information.

In academic contexts, homophily shapes co-authorship networks, fostering gendered clusters that restrict access to mentorship, resources, and high-impact collaborations, thereby sustaining inequalities across fields [@wang2023homophily]. Wang’s analysis of the JSTOR corpus shows that this pattern cannot be fully explained by disciplinary or demographic factors; even after accounting for these, researchers still preferentially co-author with same-gender colleagues. 

This is all at the dyadic level, focusing on collaborations between pairs of individuals. For example, if researcher A has the same gender as resercher B, but reseracher C is a different gender, dyadic homophily would predict it to be more likely that A sends a tie to B than to C.

However, researchers may not only be part of a dyadic duo, but maintain multiple collaborations, forming an egonet: the network of direct connections surrounding an individual [@SNASS]. As a result, decisions about whom to collaborate with are shaped not only by individual preferences but also by the broader network of existing ties. While dyadic homophily influences many collaboration choices, the structure and composition of a researcher’s egonet can create both opportunities and constraints for new collaborations.

It can thus be important to look beyond dyadic ties. This research project therefore extends the literature by examining gendered collaboration patterns in triadic structures. A triadic structure is a network configuration involving three nodes [@SNASS]; here, I focus on triads in which researcher A has collaborated with B, and B has collaborated with C. 

In this research project, I specifically investigate whether the gender of C affects A’s likelihood of collaborating with them, particularly when A and B share the same gender. Drawing on Contact Theory [@Allport] and Social Identity Theory [@Tajfel_Turner], the analysis examines how indirect connections through shared collaborators can either bridge gender boundaries to promote cross-gender ties or reinforce existing gender segregation in academic networks.

Thus, while researchers may exhibit a micro-level tendency to collaborate with others of the same gender, these individual preferences are embedded within a broader network structure that may amplify or constrain them. To examine how such dynamics unfold, I analyse the triadic structures described above using social network data on 674 researchers from sociology and politicology departments in Dutch universities. The dataset consists of two waves: wave one  (2015-2018) and wave two (2019-2023). To assess how gender shapes tie formation and maintenance within these triadic configurations, I first examine the prevalence of different triadic structures in the data and then analyse the gender composition of the two most central to my research (021C and 030T). This leads to the following two descriptive research questions:

RQ1: How frequently do different types of triadic structures occur within the network of researchers from sociology and politicology departments in Dutch Universities?

RQ2: How is gender distributed across the triadic structures, specifically triads 021C and 030T, within the network of researchers from sociology and politicology departments in Dutch Universities?

Next, I use the R package RSiena [@Rsiena] to examine triadic collaboration patterns. Specifically, I investigate whether, in a triad of the form A -> B -> C, the gender of C affects A’s likelihood of forming a collaboration when A and B share the same gender. This leads to my explanatory research question:

RQ3: To what extent does the gender of a potential third collaborator (C) influence triad closure when the initial two collaborators (A and B) share the same gender?
