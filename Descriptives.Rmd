# Descriptive Analyses
<br>

For the descriptive analyses, I will identify which triads occur in the network data, with particular attention to 021C and 030T triads (RQ1), and then examine the gender distribution within these specific triads (RQ2). The latter will be illustrated with a plot.

However, before exploring these patterns in detail, I will assess the overall gender distribution in the network, as well as key structural characteristics such as density, degree distribution, and clustering, to provide a clearer understanding of the network as a whole.

<br>

```{r}
load("./data/processed/result_gender2.rda")
```

<br>

## Gender distribution

In the study population, gender was nearly evenly distributed, with 49.70% men and 47.03% women. A small proportion of participants (3.36%, n = 22) had missing gender information.

```{r}
result_gender2$demographics |>
  mutate(gender = ifelse(is.na(gender), "missing", gender)) |>
  count(gender) |>
  mutate(percent = round(n / sum(n) * 100, 2))
```

<br>

## Network characteristics

To analyze various network characteristics, I first defined the two waves and verified that their matrices had matching dimensions, ensuring that no data were missing. On the diagonal of the network matrix, values should be zero since self-collaborations are not of interest. A few cases did not meet this criterion, so I set all diagonal entries in the adjacency matrix to zero. Finally, I confirmed that the matrices were not empty.

```{r echo=TRUE, include=TRUE, results='hide'}
wave1 <- result_gender2$nets[1,,]
wave2 <- result_gender2$nets[2,,]

# filter out the waves of the object: we need to check our input
dim(wave1)
dim(wave2)

# you need to have 0 missing values:
sum(is.na(wave1))
sum(is.na(wave2))

#check the diagonal: all places should be 0
sum(diag(wave1)==0)
sum(diag(wave2)==0)

# a few people did work with themselves:
diag(wave1) <- 0
diag(wave2) <- 0

# everything should be 1 or 0:
sum(wave1>1)
sum(wave2>1)

# check if it's not empty: there are people with 1's
sum(wave1>0)
sum(wave2>0)

# Create Igraphs for analysis
g1 <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(wave1, mode = "directed")
g2 <- graph_from_adjacency_matrix(wave2, mode = "directed")

```
### Nodes and ties

There are 674 researchers in the network; in Wave 1 there are 335 ties in total, and in Wave 2 there are 572, indicating that collaborative activity increased over time.
```{r}
# number of nodes wave 1
vcount(g1)

# number of nodes wave 2
vcount(g2)

# number of edges wave 1
ecount(g1)

# number of nodes wave 2
ecount(g2)
```

### Density

The overall network density is low in both waves (Wave 1: 0.00074; Wave 2: 0.00126), indicating that only a small fraction of all possible collaborations occurrs. The slight increase from Wave 1 to Wave 2 suggests that collaborative activity became marginally more frequent over time, although part of this increase may reflect the inclusion of researchers who joined only the sociology and political science departments within Dutch universities in Wave 2 rather than a true rise in collaborations among existing members

```{r}
# Wave 1 density
edge_density(g1)

# Wave 2 density
edge_density(g2)
```

### Indegree

In Wave 1, many researchers had no incoming collaborations, with the most connected reseracher having 8 incoming ties. In Wave 2, connectivity increased slightly: the mean in-degree rose from 0.50 to 0.85, and the most connected researcher had 14 incoming ties. Overall, people appear to have few incoming ties. 
```{r}
# Indegree Wave 1
indeg <- igraph::degree(g1, mode = "in")
summary(indeg)

# Indegree Wave 2
indeg <- igraph::degree(g2, mode = "in")
summary(indeg)

```
### Outdegree

Out-degree distributions indicate that most researchers initiated few or no collaborations in both waves. In Wave 1, the average out-degree was 0.50, and the most active researcher initiated 10 collaborations. By Wave 2, average out-degree increased to 0.85, suggesting that more researchers engaged in initiating collaborations, but the average outdegree remains low.
```{r}
# Outdegree wave 1
outdeg <- igraph::degree(g1, mode = "out")
summary(outdeg)

# Outdegree wave 2
outdeg <- igraph::degree(g2, mode = "out")
summary(outdeg)
```
### Isolates

The previous analyses suggest the presence of many isolates in the network. In Wave 1, 443 out of 674 researchers were isolates, while in Wave 2 the number decreased to 284. This substantial decrease is likely influenced by the inclusion of researchers who joined only in Wave 2, as these individuals would appear as isolates if they were artificially included in the Wave 1 network.
```{r}
# Isolates Wave 1
row_sums1 <- rowSums(wave1)
col_sums1 <- colSums(wave1)
sum(row_sums1 == 0 & col_sums1 == 0)

# Isolates Wave 2
row_sums2 <- rowSums(wave2)
col_sums2 <- colSums(wave2)
sum(row_sums2 == 0 & col_sums2 == 0)
```

## Triad census

To answer the first research question, I conduct a triad census. This allows me to see which triadic structures, specifically 021C and 030T, appear in the observed network at Wave 1 and Wave 2. 

### Wave 1

In Wave 1, 021C triads occur 190 times, while 030T triads occur 23 times. This indicates that sequantial triads (021C) are much more common than transitive triads (030T) during the first observation period.

```{r}
# Compute triad census (igraph version)
triads <- triad_census(g1)

# Define triad types
triad_types <- c(
  "003", "012", "102", "021D", "021U", "021C", 
  "111D", "111U", "030T", "030C", "201", 
  "120D", "120U", "120C", "210", "300"
)

# Combine into a data frame
triad_table <- data.frame(
  Triad = triad_types,
  Count = as.numeric(triads)
)

triad_table

```

### Wave 2

In Wave 2, both triad types appeared more frequently: 021C occurred 287 times, and 030T appeared 56 times. While this increase suggests an expansion of triadic structures, the growth may partly reflect the addition of new individuals to the network rather than a substantive change in the underlying collaboration patterns.

```{r}
# Compute triad census (igraph version)
triads <- triad_census(g2)

# Define triad types
triad_types <- c(
  "003", "012", "102", "021D", "021U", "021C", 
  "111D", "111U", "030T", "030C", "201", 
  "120D", "120U", "120C", "210", "300"
)

# Combine into a data frame
triad_table <- data.frame(
  Triad = triad_types,
  Count = as.numeric(triads)
)

triad_table
```

### Results
The answer to the first research question is that both 021C and 030T triadic structures are present in the network in both waves, with 021C consistently being the most frequent of the two. The rise in their occurrence from Wave 1 to Wave 2 points to a general increase in triadic connectivity, likely driven by network expansion rather than a shift in structural tendencies.

## Gendered triads Wave 1

In order to answer the second research question, I need to identify the gender configurations of the triads 021C and 030T. In order to this, I first need to create a dataset in which the configurations are linked to actual nodes, rather than simply counting the number of configurations as a triad census does.

Creating this dataset is computationally intensive because, for each person, every possible triad combination must be recorded. Since individuals must be connected to at least one other person to be part of a possible triad, isolates can be removed from the dataset. This reduces the dataset to 231 people in the first wave, which significantly speeds up the for-each loop.

### Dataframe

```{r, eval = FALSE}
row_sums <- rowSums(wave1)
col_sums <- colSums(wave1)
# sum(row_sums != 0 | col_sums != 0)
# 231 people remain

row_sums <- rowSums(wave1)
col_sums <- colSums(wave1)
nonzero_ties <- which(row_sums != 0 | col_sums != 0)

gender <- result_gender2$demographics$gender

triads <- c("003", "012", "102", "021D", "021U", "021C", "111D", "111U", "030T", "030C", "201", "120D", "120U", "120C", "210", "300")

df <- data.frame()

df <- foreach(a1 = nonzero_ties, i = iterators::icount(), .combine = "rbind") %:%
  foreach(a2 = nonzero_ties, j = iterators::icount(), .combine = "rbind") %:%
  foreach(a3 = nonzero_ties, k = iterators::icount(), .combine = "rbind") %do% {
    
    # Print progress for each a1 only
    if (j == 1 && k == 1) {  # only print once per a1
      print(paste0("Processing outer node a1=", a1, " (i=", i, ")"))
    }
    
    if (i > j & j > k) {  # iteration counts still control loop order
      data.frame(
        i = a1, j = a2, k = a3,           # use a1, a2, a3 as node IDs
        gender_i = gender[a1],             # original node IDs for indexing
        gender_j = gender[a2],
        gender_k = gender[a3],
        t1_ij = as.character(wave1[a1, a2]),
        t1_ji = as.character(wave1[a2, a1]),
        t1_ik = as.character(wave1[a1, a3]),
        t1_ki = as.character(wave1[a3, a1]),
        t1_jk = as.character(wave1[a2, a3]),
        t1_kj = as.character(wave1[a3, a2]),
        type = triads[which(sna::triad.census(wave1[c(a1, a2, a3), c(a1, a2, a3)]) == 1)]
      )
    }
  }

# Optional: create triad name
df$name <- paste0(df$i, ".", df$j, ".", df$k)

write.csv(df, "./data/processed/wave1excel.csv", row.names = FALSE)

### Results

Based on the analyses above, the second research question can be addressed. This research question was descriptive, focusing on how gender is distributed across the triadic structures 021C and 031T observed in the network.

![](images/dis_prop_gender3.png)

Although the overall network is approximately gender balanced with 47.0 percent female and 49.7 percent male (as seen in 1.1. Gender distribution), the composition of the 021C and 031T triadic types in Wave 1 reveals a clear over-representation of all-male groups. In 021C triads, nearly 40 percent are composed entirely of men, compared to only 7 percent all-female triads. A similar pattern appears in 031T triads, where 39 percent are all-male and 22 percent all-female. Triads in which A and B are the same gender but C differs (female-female-male or male-male-female) are considerably less frequent, particularly those with a female majority (female-female-male).

For 031T triads specifically, same gender triads are especially pronounced. Approximately 61 percent of these triads consist entirely of one gender (either all-male or all-female), while only around 8 percent are of the female-female-male or male-male-female type. Given the overall gender balance of the network, this indicates that transitive or tightly interconnected triads tend to form within same-gender groups rather than across them, particularly in all-male triads.

Taken together, the results addressing the second research question reveal gendered structuring within the 021C and 031T triads, suggesting that these network configurations are shaped by gender-based tendencies in tie formation.

### Visualisation

Now, to visualize the network of 021C triads and 030T triads I turn the dataset "df_filtered" back into an adjaceny matrix and create a gender list for those people. 

```{r}
# Assuming your dataframe is called df_filtered
df3 <- df_filtered

# Identify all unique node IDs from i, j, k
nodes <- sort(unique(c(df3$i, df3$j, df3$k)))

# Create empty adjacency matrix
adj_mat <- matrix(0, nrow = length(nodes), ncol = length(nodes))
rownames(adj_mat) <- nodes
colnames(adj_mat) <- nodes

# Fill adjacency matrix
for (row in 1:nrow(df3)) {
  i <- df3$i[row]
  j <- df3$j[row]
  k <- df3$k[row]
  
  # Make sure to only assign if the column exists in the matrix
  if (df3$t1_ij[row] == 1) adj_mat[as.character(i), as.character(j)] <- 1
  if (df3$t1_ji[row] == 1) adj_mat[as.character(j), as.character(i)] <- 1
  if (df3$t1_ik[row] == 1) adj_mat[as.character(i), as.character(k)] <- 1
  if (df3$t1_ki[row] == 1) adj_mat[as.character(k), as.character(i)] <- 1
  if (df3$t1_jk[row] == 1) adj_mat[as.character(j), as.character(k)] <- 1
  if (df3$t1_kj[row] == 1) adj_mat[as.character(k), as.character(j)] <- 1
}

# View adjacency matrix
# View(adj_mat)

#check
#row_sums <- rowSums(adj_mat)
#col_sums <- colSums(adj_mat)

Figure 1 below visualizes the gender distribution in the network of individuals involved in 021C and 030T triads. Men appear more frequently in the network and are spread widely across various clusters. Several male-dominated clusters are visible, suggesting a stronger male presence in the formation of these triads. While women are less numerous, they also form noticeable clusters, often on the network‚Äôs periphery. Overall, the structure suggests gendered patterns of connection, with men occupying more central and interconnected positions, and women appearing more often in smaller, more localized groups.

## Gendered triads wave 2

The code I developed to analyze gender distribution within the 021C and 030T triads can also be applied to wave 2 by simply replacing every instance of ‚Äúwave1‚Äù with ‚Äúwave2.‚Äù However, because wave 2 contains fewer isolates, the for-each loop would need to iterate over a much larger number of individuals. Based on my calculations, this process would take approximately three days to complete. As I did not have three consecutive days during which I did not need to use R, running the full analysis for Wave 2 was not feasible at this time. I hope my demonstration of how I approached this for Wave 1 suffices for now.
